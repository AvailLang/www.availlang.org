			<title>Newsletter #5 - The Builder</title>

			<description>It's been a busy few months, but now it's time to showcase the recent rework of Avail's most-used tool: The Builder. We need to put on our best (inter)face as we approach our release date and prepare to greet the world…</description>

			<title>Newsletter #4 - Victim of Success</title>
			<pubDate>Wed, 18 Sep 2013 13:00:00 GMT</pubDate>

Since the release of the new website, there has been a dramatic upswing in site visits and new visitors. Hello, world! Thank you for visiting our humble site!

			<description>Inspired by the many such programs that have been written since the 1967 BCPL progenitor, this archetypal and obligatory introduction demonstrates how a bright-eyed programmer can greet the entire world with just a few lines of code.
