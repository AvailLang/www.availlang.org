<p>
There are three types of licensing options for the use of Avail.
</p><p>
<strong>Individual</strong> licenses are available to individual hobbyists for personal use and personal or collaborative open-source projects.
</p><p>
<strong>General</strong> licenses are free and are for:
<ul>
	<li>Accredited educational institutions for instructional purposes.</li>
	<li>Independent contractors and businesses with three or fewer members and employees (combined).</li>
	<li>Select nonprofit businesses and charities.</li>
</ul>
</p><p>
<strong>Enterprise</strong> licenses are required for those not qualified or approved for general use. These licenses require an annual subscription fee which is on a sliding scale according to the subscriber organization's annual revenue. Subscription fees are assessed annually.
</p><p>
At the discretion of the Avail Foundation, individuals who contribute significantly to the state of the art of Avail may be awarded royalty-free enterprise-level licenses for their individual use. These licenses are subject to annual review and revocation.
