<h2 class="content-title">Grammatical Restriction</h2>

<p>
A compiler-run <a href="./function.html">function</a> that enforces a set of rules regarding what <a href="./method-call.html">method calls</a> can be used as arguments for the named method(s).
</p><p>
The addition of restrictions to multiple methods within the same statement requires that the methods all have the same number of arguments.
</p><p>
Grammatical restrictions are parts of their methods, and the effect of multiple grammatical restrictions on a single method is cumulative.
</p><p>
<strong>Grammar:</strong> <code>SET_OF_2-ARG_METHODS can’t have ‹DISALLOWED_LEFT_ARG_METHODS, DISALLOWED_RIGHT_ARG_METHODS>;</code><br />
<strong>Example:</strong> <code>{"_+_", "_-_"} can’t have <{}, {"_+_","_-_"}>;</code>
</p><p>
In this example we effect the elimination of ambiguity for nested calls that do not use parentheses (such as <code>3 + 4 + 5</code>). Since calls to <code>"_+_"</code> and <code>"_-_"</code> are not allowed in their right argument positions, the compiler must necessarily evaluate the expression from left to right.
