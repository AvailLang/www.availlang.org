<h2 class="content-title">Statement</h2>

<p>
An <a href="./expression.html">expression</a> with a return type of <a href="./top.html">⊤</a> that is terminated with a semicolon. A statement is the smallest unit that can be understood as a complete directive.
</p><p>
If a programmer wants to run a value-returning expression for its side-effects but will not use its return value, this value-returning expression can be turned into a ⊤-returning expression by passing it as the argument to the (⊤-returning, argument-value-discarding) method <code>"Ignore:_"</code>.
