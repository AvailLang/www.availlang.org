<h2 class="content-title">Semantic Restriction</h2>

<p>
A single semantic restriction enforces a set of rules regarding the meaningful usage of a method.
</p><p>
A semantic restriction may:
<ul><li>strengthen the result type of a message send if the argument types indicate that such strengthening is both possible and warranted</li>
<li>reject a message send as illegal if one or more of its arguments are deemed inappropriate based on an assessment of their types</li>
<li>encode information about the semantics of an operation in such a way that the compiler can mechanically operate upon it. In a sense, it assists the compiler in leveraging the meaning of an operation.</li></ul>
</p><p>
<strong>Grammar:</strong> <code>Semantic restriction METHOD_NAME is [ PARAM_TYPE_LIST | ANY_TYPE_CALCULUS_REQUIRED ] : OPTIONAL_TYPE;</code>
