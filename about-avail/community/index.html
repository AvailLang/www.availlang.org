		<h2 class="content-title">Community</h2>

<p>You may wish to participate casually in the development and promulgation of Avail by coding in Avail. Perhaps you'd like to discuss your experience and ideas in programming and computer science as they relate to the language and design decisions made by the Avail team. You may also wish to <a href="#contribute">contribute directly</a> to the Avail project by providing code to the Avail virtual machine or standard library, improving the functionality of the website, writing more documentation, or assisting with other tasks related to the operation of The Avail Foundation.</p>

<p>No matter how large or small your outlay of time, energy, and resources, know that your interest and investment are deeply appreciated by everyone at The Avail Foundation. We believe that we have built something unique and wonderful, and it excites and inspires us that you want to be part of it. Together we can create a toolchain that has the power to revolutionize how people design and develop software.</p>

<h3 id="contribute">Contributing</h3>

<p>The Avail <a href="/about-us/team/index.html">team</a> is small, but very dedicated and industrious. Though we have accomplished much in the years leading up to Avail's debut, our ambition is much larger than the current scale of the project. There is far more yet to do than we can reasonably achieve alone.</p>

<p>If, after browsing our site and experimenting with our technology, you are excited by Avail's potential and want to become involved in the advancement of the project, then we are happy to welcome you onboard! We are looking for new contributors from all backgrounds and in all domains of expertise. Please contact us <a class="unmarked" href="https://mailhide.io/e/qdN8uWOy" onclick="window.open('https://mailhide.io/e/qdN8uWOy', '', 'toolbar=0,scrollbars=0,location=0,statusbar=0,menubar=0,resizable=0,width=1094,height=1604'); return false;" title="Email the site administrator">directly</a> if you would like to contribute your energy and skills.</p>

<p>The Avail Foundation is currently funded solely through personal contributions made by the members of the Avail team.  If you are interested in funding development of the Avail programming language, or defraying the operational costs of The Avail Foundation, then please be aware that The Avail Foundation is a <a class="offsite" href="https://www.revenue.wi.gov/pubs/pb119.pdf">limited liability corporation</a>, not a <a class="offsite" href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/501#c_3">501(c)(3)</a>. As such, you cannot make tax-exempt donations to The Avail Foundation. You can only make monetary gifts, which are not tax exempt. For the past several years, the <a class="offsite" href="https://www.irs.gov/">IRS</a> has made it <a class="offsite" href="https://www.wired.com/2013/06/irs-open-sourc/">very difficult</a> for organizations that develop and promote open-source software to secure 501(c)(3) status, so we chose to form an LLC instead. Having said that, we still wish to apply for 501(c)(3) status, and will begin the application process in the near future.</p>

<p>Until such a time as we should reorganize into a nonprofit, if you desperately wish to contribute money, then please contact us <a class="unmarked" href="https://mailhide.io/e/qdN8uWOy" onclick="window.open('https://mailhide.io/e/qdN8uWOy', '', 'toolbar=0,scrollbars=0,location=0,statusbar=0,menubar=0,resizable=0,width=1094,height=1604'); return false;" title="Email the site administrator">directly</a>. You are advised instead, however, to consider contributing your time and energy to advancing the state of the technology whether it be through direct development or operational support.</p>

<h3 id="correspondence">Correspondence</h3>
<p>Now that we've reached our first milestone &mdash; the release of a public, open-source, development version of Avail &mdash; we ask for your patience in the coming months as we struggle to respond to incoming correspondence. We will, of course, make every effort to respond to your inquiries in a timely fashion, but inevitably there will be delays. In addition to the sweat, blood, and tears that we are pouring into Avail, we also have full-time scholastic or employment obligations. So please bear with us!</p>

<p>With that out of the way, if you have something to say to us that is best said privately, rather than in a public forum, then feel free to contact us <a class="unmarked" href="https://mailhide.io/e/qdN8uWOy" onclick="window.open('https://mailhide.io/e/qdN8uWOy', '', 'toolbar=0,scrollbars=0,location=0,statusbar=0,menubar=0,resizable=0,width=1094,height=1604'); return false;" title="Email the site administrator">directly</a>.</p>

<h3 id="report">Reporting Issues</h3>

<p>To report a problem with the Avail website or software, please help us out by taking the following steps:</p>

<ol>
	<li>
		If you have a <strong>software</strong> problem, please verify, to the best of your ability, that the problem does not result from a bug in your own code. We all write buggy code, including the developers at The Avail Foundation, so please make sure that the problem is ours and not yours â€“ so that we can concentrate our efforts on fixing our own bugs! Only proceed if you are certain that the bug's provenance makes it our problem.
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>To read about outstanding issues, perhaps to see if the problem you're encountering has already been encountered by others, and to add new issues, please use GitHub's issue tracking system for the [AvailLang/Avail][https://github.com/AvailLang/Avail] project.  Issues with this web site can be reported here as well.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>If you're reporting a software issue, you are certainly welcome to stop at #3; at this point, you have definitely done your duty as a responsible and considerate user of open-source software. If you are feeling especially ambitious, however, you may wish to tackle the bug yourself! This may be a trivial matter or a serious ordeal, depending on the nature of the bug, and providing advice to the ambitious is beyond the scope of this humble document. If you do decide to attempt a resolution yourself, then please include a statement of your intentions in the issue report. Should your efforts prove successful, we would love to get a pull request from you!</p>
		<p>If you start but give up before achieving a resolution, then simply update the issue to let us know that you are no longer working on the problem.</p>
