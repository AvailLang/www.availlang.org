		<h2 class="content-title">Community</h2>

<p>There are several ways to get involved with Avail, depending on your levels of interest and commitment. You may wish to <a href="#participate">participate casually</a> in the development and promulgation of Avail by coding up Avail projects, discussing ideas in programming and computer science and their relation to Avail, or educating others on the usage of Avail. You may also wish to <a href="#contribute">contribute directly</a> to the Avail project by providing code to the Avail virtual machine or standard library, writing documentation for the Avail website, or providing labor to The Avail Foundation.</p>

<p>No matter how large or small your outlay of time, energy, and resources, know that your interest and investment is deeply appreciated by everyone at The Avail Foundation. We believe that we have built something unique and wonderful, and it excites and inspires us that you want to be part of it. Together we can deliver a revolutionary toolchain that has the power to change how people design and develop software.</p>

<h3 id="participate">Participating</h3>

<p>If you would like to participate in the Avail community, then please join one or more of our <a href="https://www.availlang.org/mailman/listinfo">community mailing lists</a>. Avail has only recently gone live, so the mailing lists are rather sparse, and could definitely use your enthusiasm to liven them up.</p>

<h3 id="contribute">Contributing</h3>

<p>The Avail team is small, but very dedicated and industrious. Though we have accomplished much in the years leading up to Avail's debut, our ambition is much larger than the current scale of the project, and there is far more yet to do than we can reasonably achieve alone.</p>

<p>If, after browsing our site and experimenting with our technology, you are excited by Avail's potential and want to become involved in the advancement of the project, then we are happy to welcome you onboard. We are looking for new contributors from all backgrounds and in all domains of expertise. Please contact us <a class="unmarked" href="http://www.google.com/recaptcha/mailhide/d?k=01Q0QkAFTdQOKPZ8xtrmwl_g==&amp;c=512LOxSdGaO-UpsHrK2_TXZl7o-7bYfyh991efx9ATw=" onclick="window.open('http://www.google.com/recaptcha/mailhide/d?k\07501Q0QkAFTdQOKPZ8xtrmwl_g\75\75\46c\075512LOxSdGaO-UpsHrK2_TXZl7o-7bYfyh991efx9ATw\075', '', 'toolbar=0,scrollbars=0,location=0,statusbar=0,menubar=0,resizable=0,width=500,height=300'); return false;" title="Email the site administrator">directly</a> if you would like to contribute your energy and skills.</p>

<p>If you are interested in funding development of the Avail programming language, or defraying the operational costs of The Avail Foundation, then please be aware that The Avail Foundation is a <a class="offsite" href="http://www.revenue.wi.gov/pubs/pb119.pdf">limited liability corporation</a>, not a <a class="offsite" href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/501#c_3">501(c)(3)</a>. As such, you cannot make tax-exempt donations to The Avail Foundation. You can only make monetary gifts, which are not tax exempt. For the past several years, the <a class="offsite" href="http://www.irs.gov/">IRS</a> has made it <a class="offsite" href="http://www.wired.com/2013/06/irs-open-sourc/">very difficult</a> for organizations that develop and promote open-source software to secure 501(c)(3) status, so we choose to form an LLC instead. Having said that, we still wish to apply for 501(c)(3) status, and will begin the application process in the near future.</p>

<p>Until such a time as we should reorganize into a nonprofit, if you desperately wish to give us money anyway, despite the inability to write it off of your taxes, then please contact us <a class="unmarked" href="http://www.google.com/recaptcha/mailhide/d?k=01Q0QkAFTdQOKPZ8xtrmwl_g==&amp;c=512LOxSdGaO-UpsHrK2_TXZl7o-7bYfyh991efx9ATw=" onclick="window.open('http://www.google.com/recaptcha/mailhide/d?k\07501Q0QkAFTdQOKPZ8xtrmwl_g\75\75\46c\075512LOxSdGaO-UpsHrK2_TXZl7o-7bYfyh991efx9ATw\075', '', 'toolbar=0,scrollbars=0,location=0,statusbar=0,menubar=0,resizable=0,width=500,height=300'); return false;" title="Email the site administrator">directly</a>. You are advised instead, however, to consider contributing your time and labor.</p>
