<h4><a href="/about-avail/newsletters/E02.html">Good Things Come to Those Who Wait</a></h4>
<div class="content-meta-info">Edition 2 - February 8, 2013</div>
<p>In which the author barely apologizes for the ridiculously long hiatus between installments. Also, Avail ditches the 1980s computing model and goes concurrent. Those other cores aren't "extra", you know -- <em>they're for kicking it <strong>Avail-style!</strong></em>&nbsp; <a href="/about-avail/newsletters/E02.html">[read more&hellip;]</a>

<h4><a href="/about-avail/newsletters/E01.html">Wump the Wumpus</a></h4>
<div class="content-meta-info">Edition 1 - October 20, 2012</div>
<p>In this edition (the first public edition of the Avail Programming Language newsletter), we announce several additions to the Avail codebase. The first is an adaptation of Hunt the Wumpus, a text adventure game. The second is support for unwind protection in the exception handling process--the ability to execute code after an exception might have been thrown but before moving on. The third is support for computational backtracking. Backtracking enables you to specify a sequence of possible paths; the failed exploration of one path will immediately result in the exploration of the subsequent path. Using backtracking, we can solve the <strong>N queens problem</strong> in a handful of lines of elegant code!&nbsp; <a href="/about-avail/newsletters/E01.html">[read more&hellip;]</a>
