<h2 class="content-title">Learn</h2>

<p>Here may be found a collection of resources that focus on helping newcomers learn the Avail programming language.</p>

<h3>Tutorials</h3>

<p>Each tutorial is structured into several prominent sections:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Summary</strong>: This says what the tutorial is essentially about.</li>
<li><strong>Prerequisites</strong>: This describes any legwork that you must do before venturing further into the tutorial in order to maximize the benefit of the tutorial. It usually directs you to other pages within the Avail site, but may occasionally link to offsite resources.</li>
<li><strong>Goals</strong>: This describes the purpose of the tutorial itself. In particular, it describes what you are expected to learn from the tutorial, and what you should be able to do afterward.</li>
<li><strong>Complete Sources</strong>: This comprises links to the various Avail source modules that together constitute the tutorial.</li>
<li><strong>Walkthrough</strong>: Herein relevant portions of the various Avail source modules are reiterated and interleaved with gentle explanatory text.</li>
<li><strong>Further Reading</strong>: This is a collection of links to other resources that elaborate on the topics explored by the tutorial.</li>
<li><strong>Exercises</strong>: Here are ideas for projects that you may wish to try in order to increase your familiarity with Avail.</li>
</ol>

<p>In order to run any of the tutorials, or try out any of the proposed exercises, you will need to set up an Avail development environment first.</p>

<p>The following tutorials are intended to provide a very gentle introduction to programming in Avail. It is recommended that all newcomers to Avail begin with these tutorials.</p>

<ul>
<li><code><a href="./tutorials/hello-world.html">"Hello, world!"</a></code>: Inspired by the many such programs that have been written since the 1967 BCPL progenitor, this archetypal and obligatory introduction demonstrates how a bright-eyed programmer can greet the entire world with just a few lines of code. (N.B.: This does not actually greet the entire world, which would be quite spooky and odd. Do not fear.)</li>
</ul>
