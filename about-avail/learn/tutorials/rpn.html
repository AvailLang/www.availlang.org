<h2 class="content-title">Reverse Polish Notation</h2>

<h3><a id="Summary">Summary</a></h3>
<p><a class="offsite" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_Polish_notation">Reverse Polish Notation</a> (RPN) is an arithmetic notation in which the operators follow their operands. Assuming operators with fixed arities, this postfix operator scheme obviates the need for parentheses. There are also several studies that indicate that users of RPN calculators make fewer mistakes than users of formula calculators.</p>

<p>At some point during formal education, many computer science students are tasked with creating an RPN calculator. There are several different approaches to this project, depending on the pedagogical emphasis, but perhaps the most common involves building a parser that accepts an RPN formula and uses a stack-based interpreter to produce a result.</p>

<p>In this tutorial, we remove all possible educational opportunities from the task of building an RPN calculator by presenting a technique that allows a programmer to bypass all that tedious mucking about with parsers, stacks, and interpreters.</p>

<p>As a bonus, our RPN domain-specific language (DSL) interoperates directly with regular Avail code. Securing the same bonus in a traditional programming language involves rebuilding its parser, thereby causing it to no longer be the original language. Avail, on the other hand, is designed to sail the <a class="offsite" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ship_of_theseus">ship of Theseus</a> all the way home.</p>

<p>Running the program should look something like this:</p>

<p>This project comprises just one small source module. Let's turn our attention to it now.</p>

<![CDATA[

	"Avail"
]]>
</script></div></div>

<p><strong>Lines 34-35</strong> just import the standard library. Big deal. We've already seen this, so let's move on.</p>

<div class="restricted-width-container">
<div class="neutral-code code-block"><script type="syntaxhighlighter" class="brush: plain; first-line: 36">
<![CDATA[

	"Avail" =
	(
		"_+_" → "__+",
		"_-_" → "__-",
		"_×_" → "__×",
		"_×_" → "__*",
		"_÷_" → "__÷",
		"_÷_" → "__/"
	)
]]>
</script></div></div>

<p><strong>Lines 36-45</strong> also imports from the standard library, but there are several new twists here. The <code>Extends</code> keyword <a href="/about-avail/documentation/modules/extended-imports-section.html">enumerates modules that should be imported</a>, just like <code>Uses</code>, but it also re-exports any imported features for use by other modules downstream.</p>

<p>Now notice the equals and the parentheses. This syntax establishes an <strong>import filter</strong>. An import filter allows you to cherry pick the method names that you want to access. (Obviously, the only names available for cherry picking are those which the target module exports.) In this case, we are importing the methods <code>"_+_"</code>, <code>"_-_"</code>, <code>"_&times;_"</code>, and <code>"_&divide;_"</code>. But we are not importing them under their given names&hellip;</p>

<p>Check out the structural similarities of <strong>lines 39-44</strong>. Each line comprises a pair of string literals separated by a <em>rightwards arrow</em> <code>&rarr;</code> <code class="unicode">(U+2192)</code>. The first string is the name of an exported method. The second string is the name by which that method should be known locally. So the pairing expresses the programmer's desire to rename. Because these renames occur inside the <code>Extends</code> section, these old methods are visible in downstream importers of <code>"RPN"</code>, <em>but only by their new names</em>. Indeed, these methods would not even be visible in this module under their original names, except that they were imported implicitly, with their original names, in the <code>Uses</code> section.</p>

<p>Taking <strong>line 41</strong> as a concrete example, <code class="module">Avail</code> exports a method <code>"_&times;_"</code> which we would like to call <code>"__&times;"</code> in the body of this module. Note that this is two blanks, each of which represents an argument position, followed by a <em>multiplication sign</em> <code>&times;</code> <code class="unicode">(U+00D7)</code>. As you probably guessed, this method multiplies two <code><a href="/about-avail/documentation/type-system/types-number.html">number</a></code>s &mdash; the multiplicand and the multiplier &mdash; together to obtain their product. But in this module and its importers, these operations use postfix notation rather than infix notation. Through the alchemy of method renaming, <strong>lines 39-44</strong> conjure our RPN DSL into existence virtually <em>ex nihilo</em>. We didn't need to build a single method in order to write the RPN DSL!</p>

<p>One more thing. <strong>Lines 41-42</strong> each have <code>"_&times;_"</code> on the left, and <strong>lines 43-44</strong> each have <code>"_&divide;_"</code> on the right. This is fine, because each righthand side is distinct. We simply end up with two renames of <code>"_&times;_"</code> and two renames of <code>"_&divide;_"</code>. The first rename in each pair creates a pretty postfix name, and the second one creates a pragmatic ASCII name that is easy to type.</p>

Method "RPN_" is
[
	expression : number

	Print: “expression”;

];
]]>
</script></div></div>

<p><strong>Lines 50-56</strong> define the method <code class="command">"RPN_"</code>. On <strong>line 53</strong>, <code>expression : number</code> is a <strong>parameter declaration</strong> which introduces a parameter named <code>expression</code> of type <code>number</code>. The parameters of a <code><a href="/about-avail/documentation/type-system/types-function.html">function</a></code> are supplied in the same order as the argument positions specified by the method name. <code class="command">"RPN_"</code> has a single argument position, the blank, which corresponds to the only parameter declaration of the function. The vertical line on <strong>line 54</strong> visually separates the parameter declarations from the function body. (It is also a possible nod to Smalltalk's many influences on Avail, but we can forgive it that.)</p>

<p><strong>Line 55.</strong> Here we see another call site of <code>"Print:_"</code>. But something interesting is happening here. Recall that <code>"Print:_"</code> requires a <code><a href="/about-avail/documentation/type-system/types-string.html">string</a></code>, and <code>expression</code> is a <code>number</code>. See those "smart quotes" &mdash; <em>left</em> <code>&ldquo;</code> <code class="unicode">(U+201C)</code> and <em>right double quotation mark</em> <code>&rdquo;</code> <code class="unicode">(U+201D)</code>, respectively &mdash; around <code>expression</code>? This is a call site of the method <code>"&ldquo;_&rdquo;"</code>, the stringification method. It accepts an arbitrary value &mdash; an instance of <code><a href="/about-avail/documentation/type-system/types-any.html">any</a></code> &mdash; and produces a <code>string</code> that represents that value textually. In the case of a <code>number</code>, it will produce a suitable numeral. The compiler arranges for the two methods <code>"Print:_"</code> and <code>"“_”"</code> to compose in the only way that is semantically valid, so at runtime <code>"“_”"</code> will run first and <code>"Print:_"</code> will run second (on the stringifier's result).</p>

<p>Since <strong>line 47</strong> names <code class="command">"RPN_"</code> as an entry point, Avail uses the grammar <em>exported by</em> <code>"RPN"</code> rather than the grammar <em>available to</em> <code class="module">RPN</code> in deciding how to parse an external call site.</p>

<p>Recall <code class="command">RPN 55 105 -</code> from the <code>Command</code> input field of the workbench presented in the <a href="#Summary">Summary</a>. This RPN formula constitutes an <strong>external call site</strong> of the method <code class="command">"RPN_"</code>, because it is compiled and executed external to any source module. The <code>Command</code> text field of the Avail workbench is always an external call site. The complete text of an external call site is called a <strong>command</strong>. The top-level syntax available at an external call site is the union of all entry points belonging to loaded modules.</p>

<p>For our purposes, assume that the only top-level syntax available here is <code class="command">"RPN_"</code>, and the only subordinate syntaxes that are both grammatically and semantically valid as input at the external call site are:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>"__+"</code>,</li>
<li><code>"__-"</code>,</li>
<li><code>"__&times;"</code>,</li>
<li><code>"__*"</code>,</li>
<li><code>"__&divide;"</code>,</li>
<li>and <code>"__/"</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>No other expressions are legal here, so our program really is a complete RPN DSL. It has exactly those facilities which we explicitly provided, and no others. As proof of this point, this is what happens if you try to use an infix arithmetic operator in an <code class="command">"RPN_"</code> command:</p>

<img src="/_images/examples/rpn/bad-command.png" alt="A sample transcript of using &quot;RPN_&quot; incorrectly."/>

<p>That mess of red text is the compiler's way of informing you that something went wrong. In this case, the <code>Expected... simple expression</code> message means that the compiler was expecting a literal value, like a numeral, rather than an operator like <code>+</code>&hellip; because we took away all of the infix operators! (<code>Expected... end of command</code> means that the compiler would have been happy if the whole command had just been <code class="command">RPN 2</code>.)</p>
