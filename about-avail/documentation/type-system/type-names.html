		<h2 class="content-title">Type Names</h2>
<p>
A type may be named for convenience and comprehensibility, but a name is never regarded as part of a type. This distinguishes Avail's types from those found in other programming languages. When a name constitutes an intrinsic property of a type, then <strong>nominative typing</strong> is at play. In nominative typing, two types that have otherwise identical properties are considered unequal if they are differently named. In Avail, membership is the only intrinsic property of a type. Type names are extrinsic, and therefore many names may be given to the same type without altering its own value. Both <code>integer</code> and <code>ℤ</code> are perfectly reasonable names for <code>{…, -1, 0, 1, …}ᵀ</code>, and Avail permits both simultaneously; the former will probably be favored for common usage, but the second may add value to code that is highly number theoretic.
</p>
<p>
A <strong>type name</strong> is a source code construct only, a chiefly linguistic expression that features a method, constant, or variable that happens to yield a type. Because the widest possible scope for a constant or variable is a single module, a type name meant to span several modules must correspond to a method invocation. It will usually be the case that such broad visibility is desired, so a type name will usually be a method invocation. The following example illustrates type names:
</p>
<div class="restricted-width-container">
<div class="good-code code-block">/* This binds the primitive type {…, -1, 0, 1, …}ᵀ to the constant "_integer" so
 * that the compiler can use its exact value for inference in the method below.
 * There's no rhyme or reason to the value 13; it's just where the integer type
 * happens to live in the virtual machine's table of primitive values. An Avail
 * programmer won't need to know anything about this table, so don't sweat the
 * details.
 */
_integer ::= special object 13;

/* Whenever the type name "integer" appears in source code, this method will be
 * invoked. Its answer is the value bound to "_integer". Because this constant
 * is defined at module scope, the compiler can infer that the return type of the
 * method implementation is {{…, -1, 0, 1, …}ᵀ}ᵀ.
 */
Method "integer" is [ _integer ];

/* Following are equivalent variable declarations, except of course that they
 * result in three different variables. Each of "integer", "_integer", and "special
 * object 13" are type expressions that reference the same primitive type {…, -1,
 * 0, 1, …}ᵀ. The first two are easily construed as type names.
 */
x : integer;
y : _integer;
z : special object 13;
Assert: x's type = y's type = z's type;</div>
</div>
<p>
As the above declaration of <code>z</code> indicates, even an expression that requires arguments may serve as a type name. This particular usage might stretch intuition about what constitutes a name, but highlights something more important: in reality, there are no type names in Avail; merely expressions that happen to produce types.
