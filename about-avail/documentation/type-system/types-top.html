		<h2 class="content-title"><code>⊤ (top)</code></h2>
<p>
<code>⊤</code> is the most general type of the Avail type lattice. It is pronounced "top" and written as the <em>down tack</em> (<code>U+22A4</code>) character. In Avail, every value is an instance of <code>⊤</code>, and every type is a <a href="./type-relations.html">subtype</a> of <code>⊤</code>.
</p>
<p>
<code>⊤</code> is distinct from <code><a href="./types-any.html">any</a></code> in that it includes exactly one additional value: the special value <code>nil</code>. This value does not satisfy any public protocol and is not available to an Avail programmer. It is, however, implicitly returned from every <strong>procedure</strong>, that is, function whose return type is <code>⊤</code>. Thus <code>nil</code> is the value produced if and only if no exposed value is produced. The virtual machine uses <code>nil</code> to simplify several core algorithms, but exposure of this special value to an Avail programmer would not yield a net good.
</p>
<p>
<code>⊤</code> typically appears in Avail code in only a few select contexts:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
As the return type of a function definition or <a href="./types-function.html">function type</a>. In this context, it signifies that the function does not produce a value when applied, i.e., it produces the unexposed value <code>nil</code>.
</li>
<li>As the return type of a <a href="./types-continuation.html">continuation type</a>. In this context, it signifies that the continuation will not produce a value when exited, i.e., it produces the unexposed value <code>nil</code>.
</li>
<li>
As the read type of a <a href="./types-variable.html">variable type</a>. In this context, it signifies that no value may be read from the variable; the variable is write-only.
</li>
<li>
As the idempotent initial value of an accumulator variable whose intermediate and final results represent a chain of type intersections. (Remember the identity law that states that the type intersection of <code>⊤</code> with some type <code>A</code> is always <code>A</code>.)
</li>
<li>
As the result of a semantic restriction that serves only to reject parses based on the types of the arguments (but does not strengthen the return type).
</li>
<li>
As the result type of a phrase type. In this context, it signifies that the phrase serves as a <strong>statement</strong>, an expression that does not produce a value.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
A function whose declared return type is <code>⊤</code> is still permitted to answer an exposed — non-<code>nil</code> — value. This is consistent with the type lattice, since every value is an instance of <code>⊤</code>. It is useful, moreover, because a semantic restriction may strengthen the return type of a <code>⊤</code>-valued function at a particular call site to a subtype of <code>⊤</code>. As an example, <code>"If|if_then_else_"</code> may be used either as a statement or a value-producing expression:
</p>
<div class="restricted-width-container">
<div class="good-code code-block">/* Allow "If|if_then_else_" to be used either as a statement or as an expression.
 * It is ⊤-valued, so before this semantic restriction can be enforced, it can
 * only be used as a statement.
 */
Semantic restriction "If|if_then_else_" is
[
	predicate : boolean's type,
	then : []→⊤'s type,
	else : []→⊤'s type
|
	/* Capture the return types of "then" and "else". We will need them. */
	thenReturnType ::= then's return type;
	elseReturnType ::= else's return type;
	/* The return type of one (or both) of the functions will be used to
	 * determine the return type of an "If|if_then_else_" expression.
	 *
	 * If the exact type of the precidate is not known, i.e., if the type
	 * does not indicate that the predicate is necessarily true or
	 * necessarily false, then answer the type union of the return types of
	 * the two functions.
	 *
	 * If the predicate is necessarily true, then answer the first function's
	 * return type; otherwise, answer the second function's return type.
	 *
	 * Wait, this is weird, isn't it? The semantic restriction uses the very
	 * method that it's trying to restrict! This is okay, it just means that
	 * only the semantic restrictions previously defined will be applied by
	 * the compiler here. Since we are trying to define the very capability
	 * of using "If|if_then_else_" as an expression, we can't use that trick
	 * here. Instead we have to treat it as a statement.
	 */
	returnType : type;
	If predicate = boolean
	then
	[
		returnType := thenReturnType ∪ elseReturnType;
	]
	else
	[
		If predicate = true's type
		then [returnType := thenReturnType;]
		else
		[
			Assert: predicate = false's type;
			returnType := elseReturnType;
		];
	];
	returnType
];

/* Read a natural number from the console. Store the smaller of "x" and 100
 * into "maxOf100". Use "If|if_then_else" as an expression.
 */
x : natural number := next natural number from console;
maxOf100 : natural number := if x &gt; 100 then [100] else [x];

/* Read a natural number from the console. Store the larger of "y" and 100 into

<p>
 <code>⊤</code> is expressly forbidden from occurring in most contexts, including the following:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
As a parameter type of a function definition or <a href="./types-function.html">function type</a>.
</li>
<li>
As a parameter type of a <a href="./types-continuation.html">continuation type</a>.
</li>
<li>
As the write type of a <a href="./types-variable.html">variable type</a>. This also correctly implies that it cannot be the type of an actual variable.
</li>
<li>
As a leading type or the default type of a <a href="./types-tuple.html">tuple type</a>.
</li>
<li>
As the element type of a <a href="./types-set.html">set type</a>.
</li>
<li>
As the key type or value type of a <a href="./types-map.html">map type</a>.
</li>
<li>
As the attribute value type of an <a href="./types-object.html">object type</a>.
</li>
<li>
As the type parameter of a <a href="./types-pojo.html">POJO type</a>.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Note that these prohibitions, when considered in aggregate, negate any possible value that could be gleaned from exposing the special value <code>nil</code> to an Avail program. They conspire together to ensure that <code>nil</code> could never be retained by an Avail value. It may therefore only exist as a temporary within a continuation, that is, an item on the local stack of a function call. A reflective query of a continuation's temporaries that would answer <code>nil</code> will instead produce an uninitialized variable whose read type is <code>⊥</code>.
</p>
<p>
Please do not confuse <code>nil</code> with the <a href="./types-bottom.html">null reference</a> present in other imperative programming languages.
