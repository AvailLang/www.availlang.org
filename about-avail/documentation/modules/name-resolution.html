    <figcaption>The flow of names into, out of, and through an Avail module is controlled by its header sections.</figcaption>
</figure>


<p>Names are the currency of modules. Names flow into modules through <a href="./private-imports-section.html">private imports</a> and <a href="./extended-imports-section.html">extended imports</a> sections. Names flow out of modules through <a href="./introduced-names-section.html">introduced names</a> and extended imports sections.</p>

<p>Names are not constrained to be globally unique within a project, as this would be a heinous requirement. Even following perfectly reasonable (but not <a class="offsite" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procrustes">Procrustean</a>) naming conventions, it is extremely likely that unaffiliated vendors would introduce name collisions. Despite having the ability to <a href="./private-imports-section.html#rule2">import a name under a new name</a>, a programmer would find name selection an onerous task.</p>

<p>Every name is associated with an <a href="/about-avail/documentation/type-system/types-atom.html">atom</a> that is created at the point of the name's original introduction. Think of an atom as a discrete particle of identity. Most values in Avail are identityless, so atoms are interesting just by dint of having identity. As such, it is occasionally useful to resolve a name to an atom for no other reason than to obtain the atom. It is more often the case, however, that a dependent module imports a name because it wishes to use the associated method in its <a href="./module-bodies.html">body</a>.</p>

<p>There are only two ways to introduce a name:</p>

<ol>
<li>By mentioning the name, as a <a href="/about-avail/documentation/type-system/types-string.html">string literal</a>, in an introduced names section.</li>
<li>By resolving a name to an atom when no atom in scope corresponds to that name. All names introduced in this fashion are private to the resolving module (unless dynamically exported with <code class="method"><a href="/about-avail/documentation/stacks/library-documentation/avail/Avail/Foundation/Bootstrap/Primitives/3778693273.html">"Export_as a new name"</a></code>).</li>
</ol>

<p>There are two ways to reference a name within a module body:</p>

<ol>
<li>By sending a message that resolves a name to an atom, such as <code class="method"><a href="/about-avail/documentation/stacks/library-documentation/avail/Avail/Foundation/Very%20Early%20Definers/2215474179.html">"Method_is_"</a></code> or <code class="method"><a href="/about-avail/documentation/stacks/library-documentation/avail/Avail/Foundation/Bootstrap/Primitives/2402682501.html">"atom for_"</a></code>, to a <a href="/about-avail/documentation/type-system/types-string.html">string</a> that represents a name.</li>
<li>By using the name to send a message. In this case, the compiler parses the source text to identify the names that correspond to expressions. For example, the compiler parses <code>1 + 3</code> to discover a send of <code class="method">"_+_"</code>. Once the name has been determined, the compiler uses available type information to resolve it to an atom.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Module resolution</strong> is the process by which names are resolved to atoms.</p>

Let <code>C</code> denote the <a href="/about-avail/documentation/type-system/types-set.html">set</a> of candidate atoms:

	<blockquote style="font-size: 14pt"><code>C &#8797; {A<sub>0</sub>, A<sub>1</sub>, &hellip;, A<sub>n</sub>}</code>,</blockquote>

where <code>A<sub>0</sub></code> through <code>A<sub>n</sub></code> are the candidate atoms.

	<li class="resolution-rules"><code>|C| &ge; 2</code>: <code>N</code> is a viable name for any element of <code>C</code>, so <code>N</code> has <strong>surface ambiguity</strong>. It may be possible <a href="#typeInfo">to use type information</a> to further disambiguate <code>N</code>.</li>
	</ul>

<dt class="resolution-rules"><em><a id="typeInfo">Is type information available to disambiguate the name?</a></em></dt>
<dd>Is any argument type information available to assist in the disambiguation of <code>N</code>?

<dd>Method arguments are statically typed. Use this type information to determine which visible method definitions are applicable at the call site of <code>N</code>.

</dl>

<p>Consider the following example:</p>

<div class="restricted-width-container">
<div class="neutral-code code-block"><script type="syntaxhighlighter" class="brush: plain; first-line: 33">
<![CDATA[
Module "Summation"
Uses
	"Avail" = ("Method_is_", "number", "_+_"),
	"Dimensional Analysis" = ("dimensioned quantity", "_+_")
Extends
	"Dimensional Analysis" = ("__", "m", "s")
Entries
	"sum of_and_"
Body

Method "sum of_and_" is
[
	a : number,
	b : number
|
	a + b
];

Method "sum of_and_" is
[
	a : dimensioned quantity,
	b : dimensioned quantity
|
	a + b
];
]]>
</script></div></div>

<p>The module <code class="module">Summation</code> imports the name <code>"_+_"</code> from each of <code class="module">Avail</code> and <code class="module">Dimensional Analysis</code>. Each of these modules separately defines an atom named <code>"_+_"</code>. This module is nonetheless valid, because the resolution of <code>"_+_"</code> to an atom is never ambiguous. On <strong>line 48</strong>, the arguments of <code>"_+_"</code> are known to be <a href="/about-avail/documentation/type-system/types-number.html">numbers</a>, which unambiguously identifies the method (and therefore the associated atom) to be the <code>"_+_"</code> introduced and exported by <code class="module">Avail</code>. On <strong>line 56</strong>, each argument is a <code>dimensioned quantity</code>, so the correct <code>"_+_"</code> is the one introduced and exported by <code>"Dimensional Analysis"</code>.</p>

<p>Now consider another (contrived) case, where the programmer wants to override <code>"_+_"</code> with new behavior.</p>

<div class="restricted-width-container">
<div class="bad-code code-block"><script type="syntaxhighlighter" class="brush: plain; first-line: 33">
<![CDATA[
Module "Bad String Addition"
Uses
	"Avail" = ("Method_is_", "string", "_+_", "_++_"),
	"Dimensional Analysis" = ("_+_")
Body

/* This doesn't work, because "_+_" is ambiguous. */
Method "_+_" is
[
	a : string,
	b : string
|
	a ++ b
];
]]>
</script></div></div>

<p>In <code class="module">Bad String Addition</code>, the method <code>"_+_"</code> is overridden with a new definition, one sufficient to concatenate two strings. But <em>which</em> <code>"_+_"</code> should be overridden? There are two in scope: one from <code class="module">Avail</code> and one from <code class="module">Dimensional Analysis</code>. In the previous example, the code was sending <code>"_+_"</code>, so the types of the arguments were available to assist in name resolution. But in this example, no such information is available; the method definer, <code>"Method_is_"</code>, has only the lexical name of the desired atom to guide it, and there are two visible atoms with the same lexical name. Compilation will therefore fail as a direct consequence of name resolution failure.</p>
