<td class="what" colspan="3">
Collaborate on the design and implementation of the Avail programming language. <small>(<em>N.B.</em> The Avail Foundation formally came into existence in 2012, but I began working on Avail in 2008.)</small>

<ul>
<li>
Designed and implemented the Avail server. The virtual machine now incorporates a high-performance, asynchronous, multi-threaded, standards-compliant implementation of WebSocket (RFC 6455). Web clients can leverage this mechanism to load Avail modules, interrogate an Avail system, and execute programs written in Avail.
</li>

<li>
Designed and implemented the Avail concurrency mechanisms. Avail threads are lightweight agents that are transiently bound to native threads by a preemptive scheduler, thereby utilizing multiple CPUs while also transcending the concurrency and resource limits of the underlying OS. High-level synchronization mechanisms emerge gracefully from atomic primitives, such as compare-and-swap, that operate on semantic equality. Avail elides low-level synchronization when accessing objects that provably cannot be referenced by multiple threads.
</li>

<li>
Designed and implemented the bidirectional Avail-Java foreign function interface. Avail's type lattice includes the complete Java type system, but does not erase generic type specializations, thereby providing stronger, safer semantics for Java types than Java itself. Avail permits direct access to Java objects and operations. Avail entry points may be called directly from Java via an asynchronous callback mechanism.
</li>

<li>
Designed and implemented the Avail standard library. Ported numerous core facilities from the prototypical Avail system originally built by Mark van Gulik.
</li>

<li>
Designed and implemented numerous other subsystems of Avail, e.g., parallel compilation, module persistence, transactional change propagation, strongly typed dimensional analysis, unit testing framework, computational backtracking, asynchronous I/O, generators, signal-and-urgent-wait monitors, etc.
</li>

<li>
Developed and presented a ten-part lecture series aimed at teaching the philosophy, concepts, and usage of the Avail programming language.
</li>

<li>
Author philosophical, technical, and pedagogical content for the official <a class="intentional-full-path" href="http://www.availlang.org">Avail website</a>.

Design, implement, maintain, and support commercial products. Lead all application developers. Institutionalize IT and oversee IT operations and budget. Participate in business development, especially marketing. Write grant proposals in response to relevant funding opportunity announcements (FOAs).

<ul>
<li>
Created Guruler, an application development platform that integrates a powerful rule engine with a high-performance server and a distributed database. The platform tightly integrates: an optimizing compiler for a strictly-typed, high-performance domain-specific language (DSL) designed to enable non-technical subject matter experts (SMEs) to develop complex rulesets and formulae; a suite of development tools, including visualization tools for understanding networks of rules and associated state variables; a customizable, asynchronous, parallel rule engine; a high-throughput, deadlock-free, asynchronous, WebSocket-enabled application server; a fully auditable, blob-oriented, distributed, multi-tenant database that automatically generates and maintains indices and data stores in accordance with query, reporting, and aggregation rules defined in the DSL; and a skinnable modern web client. The system supports live or automated intake by multiple simultaneous users, potentially editing through disparate semantic views, and generates appropriate reports, alerts, and events. The system implements a uniform security policy that crosscuts all application layers. The main product built on the platform is the eponymous My Coverage Plan&trade;, a customer decision support tool intended to help advocates and patients to secure healthcare benefits.
</li>

<li>
Architected Guruler. Designed the DSL. Implemented the optimizing compiler, the development tools, the application server, and the initial web client in the first six (6) months. Designed the persistence layer. Designed all security policies. Participated in architectural and security discussions and exercised product authority throughout. Produced the My Coverage Plan&trade; product in one (1) year with a team of three (3) on a minimal budget.
</li>

<li>
Identified, interviewed, hired, managed, led, and mentored all application developers. Set development guidelines and established code style standards for Avail, Java, and TypeScript. Conducted code reviews. Managed product development, establishing milestones and feature sets. Produced Gantt charts and other project management instruments to keep stakeholders apprised of development progress. Trained SMEs on use of the DSL and the My Coverage Plan&trade; tool. Produced official product documentation. Presented official product demonstrations to partners and customers. Wrote grant proposals to obtain funding for marketing the My Coverage Plan&trade; product.
</li>

<li>
Institutionalized IT best practices. Oversaw IT operations. Built-out the private virtual cloud (VPC) in Amazon Web Services (AWS) that ran the My Coverage Plan&trade; product. Managed and budgeted AWS resources. Performed all necessary system administration, including security updates.

Designed, implemented, maintained, and supported commercial products.

<ul>
<li>
Created <a class="offsite" href="http://databarrage.com">Barrage</a>, a strictly-typed, high-performance domain-specific language (DSL) for specifying patterns within time-series data generated by Internet of Things (IoT) sensors. The Barrage runtime applies these patterns to discover complex events and report them. Designed the Barrage compiler and implemented it in Avail. Prototyped the Barrage virtual machine (VM) in Smalltalk. Designed the production Barrage VM and implemented it in Java, using dynamic translation of Barrage bytecodes to Java bytecodes to maximize performance.
</li>

<li>
Designed and implemented MIOsoft's MIOplexer&trade;, a platform-neutral network transport layer engineered to scale significantly beyond the 16-bit port limitations imposed on user applications by TCP implementations. MIOplexer provides deep, efficient network buffering and a robust service architecture that supports anycast and multicast addressing, load balancing, persistence of identity, and reliable notification of events. The existing deployments effectively and efficiently manage tens of millions of active communication endpoints distributed across thousands of user applications and hundreds of nodes while requiring only commodity hardware.
</li>

<li>
Designed and implemented vital subsystems of MIOsoft’s MIOedge&trade; cloud platform. MIOedge conjoins a business application development environment, a high-performance distributed object database engine, and a sophisticated <em>ad hoc</em> reporting apparatus. The existing deployments include multi-petabyte databases supported by hundreds of nodes.
</li>

<li>
Designed and implemented fast parallel algorithms for performing statistical analysis of extremely large datasets (i.e. &gt; 1 TB). Sub-second responses are normal for datasets of &lt; 1 million records. Algorithms were specifically engineered to maximize disk and network throughput while avoiding contention between the participating hosts.
</li>

<li>
Developed and maintained a custom VisualWorks virtual machine for use with MIOedge. In particular, resolved critical defects in the virtual machine’s garbage collection, dynamic translation, network I/O, and event notification subsystems. Introduced numerous performance enhancements and supplementary features. These modifications enabled the use of the platform for reliably developing and deploying enterprise applications.
</li>

<li>
Designed, implemented, and maintained numerous other subsystems of MIOedge, e.g. object indexing, object relationship management, object caching, data parsing, code generation, internationalization (specifically Chinese language support), user interface, etc.
