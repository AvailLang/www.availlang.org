Rich lingered in college for a bit, and as a result of his extended stay, he holds a bachelors degree in Classical Civilizations from Florida State University, a bachelors degree in Mathematics  from the University of South Florida, and a masters degree in mathematics from Cleveland State University. In addition to his experience developing client-facing database applications, he has a diverse professional background that includes data analytics, operations, insurance, and education. Aside from additions to the Avail virtual machine and the Avail standard library, he wrote the very first Avail program; a quiz domain specific language. When not programming, he handles the majority of the business side of the Avail Foundation, LLC.

Over the years she's had a variety of job titles, but she always ends up working with and designing software, doing visual design, and writing documentation and training materials. She is currently working on all of the above for the Avail project. Specifically, her ongoing contributions include additions of both code and documentation to the Avail virtual machine and library, writing and editing external documentation, and maintenance of the website.

<a id="Todd" href="todd-smith-resume.html"><h4>Todd L. Smith</h4></a>Todd is the Chief Executive Officer of the Avail Foundation, LLC. He holds a Bachelor of Arts in Classical Civilization from Florida State University. Having learned to read Latin extremely well and Attic Greek fair to middling, he decided to pursue a career in software so that he could actually pay his bills. He has written production-quality software in sixteen general-purpose programming languages for a variety of companies of varying industry, size, and prominence. He has always daydreamed of greater expressivity than was available in traditional programming languages. Avail first asserted its inexorable influence over him when he learned of its existence in 2007 as a result of his new friendship with Mark van Gulik; he was quite unable to resist its seductive promises of articulate programming. As of August 2013, he has written about 1.5 megabytes of Avail source code, including the majority of the Avail standard library, and contributed about 20% of the virtual machine by code volume. When he is poked hard enough, he produces end-user documentation. When he is poked even harder, he focuses on the droll necessities of operating a business that no has near-term commercial prospects.

In 1993, his dissatisfaction with the state of the art finally led him to start implementing Avail in his spare time.  He worked primarily as a consultant in North America and Europe while continuing to develop Avail from 1993 until 2008, when the Avail team started to grow.  With this head start, he invented most of the concepts, technologies, and infrastructure of Avail.  Mark is currently focusing his effort toward improving portions of the Avail virtual machine such as the dynamic translator and the macro compiler.  His training in classical piano somehow survived his collision with computers in high school, although its fate is unclear in the balance of full time work, acting as the Avail Foundation's Chief Technology Officer, actually developing Avail, and raising five kids with his wife in Madison, Wisconsin.
