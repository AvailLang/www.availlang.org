<strong>Leslie Schultz</strong> joined the Avail team in 2011 and will be graduating from the University of Wisconsin Madison this June with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science. Over the years she's had a variety of job titles, but she always ends up working with and designing software, doing visual design, and writing documentation and training materials. She is currently working on all of the above for the Avail project. Specifically, her ongoing contributions include additions of both code and documentation to the Avail virtual machine and library, writing and editing external documentation, and maintenance of the website.

<strong>Todd L. Smith</strong> is the Chief Executive Officer of the Avail Foundation, LLC. He holds a Bachelor of Arts in Classical Civilization from Florida State University. Having learned to read Latin extremely well and Attic Greek fair to middling, he decided to pursue a career in software so that he could actually pay his bills. He has written production-quality software in sixteen general-purpose programming languages for a variety of companies of varying industry, size, and prominence. He has always daydreamed of greater expressivity than was available in traditional programming languages. Avail first asserted its inexorable influence over him when he learned of its existence in 2007 as a result of his new friendship with Mark van Gulik; he was quite unable to resist its seductive promises of fluent programming. As of August 2013, he has written nearly two megabytes of Avail source code, including the majority of the Avail standard library, and contributed about 20% of the virtual machine by code volume. When he is poked hard enough, he produces end-user documentation. When he is poked even harder, he focuses on the droll necessities of operating a business.
