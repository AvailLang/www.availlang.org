		<p>Design, implement, maintain, and support commercial products related to the Guruler platform, an application development platform that integrates a powerful rule engine with a high-performance server and a distributed database. The platform tightly integrates: a compiler for a strictly-typed, high-performance domain-specific language (DSL) designed to enable non-technical subject matter experts (SMEs) to develop complex rulesets and formulae; a suite of development tools, including visualization tools for understanding networks of rules and associated state variables; a customizable, asynchronous, parallel rule engine; a high-throughput, deadlock-free, asynchronous, WebSocket-enabled application server; a fully auditable, blob-oriented, distributed, multi-tenant database that automatically generates and maintains indices and data stores in accordance with query, reporting, and aggregation rules defined in the DSL; and a skinnable modern web client. The system supports live and automated intake by multiple simultaneous users, potentially editing through disparate semantic views, and generates appropriate reports, alerts, and events. The system implements a uniform security policy that crosscuts all application layers. The main product built on the platform is the eponymous My Coverage Plan™, a customer decision support tool intended to help advocates and patients to secure healthcare benefits.</p>
