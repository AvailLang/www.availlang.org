It is really awesome to be moving over from our Google Code page to our very own site!  We get to do all these nifty new things, like write blogs!  Now this stuff didn't magically appear the moment we got hosting for our site.  Many hours of hard work has gone into making this happen.  Many thanks to our very own Leslie for making this site and, as a result, this blog possible!  Oh and I think Todd did some copying and pasting or some such stuff too. ;)
</p><p>
So what sorts of stuff can you expect to see in my upcoming blog entries?  Well, you'll get to ride along as I perform various functions for Avail.  I'll not bore you with the details of what customer service reps I sat on hold with nor what attorney I spoke to for whatever reason.  No, it is my intent to let you look in on the most interesting of my endeavors (I hope): my programming exploits.  Keep in mind that I'm new to the programming trade.  Before moving to Madison I was an analyst; I worked mostly with SAS and SQL.  In my current job, I do some SmallTalk on a database application development platform (but I mostly do project and operations management, sigh...).  I've dabbled ever so briefly in C (courtesy of Todd circa 2001) and most recently I've experimented with Java.  In high school I even took a class on FORTRAN...that I did on paper by hand (my teacher would look at my loose leaf paper program and declare its correctness; he was quite the compiler).  So it is safe to say that, of all the languages I know, I know Avail the best!  So follow along the exploits of a math nerd that is learning to program in a newly developed language.
</p><p>
To catch you up on what I've most recently been working on, I'm working on a program that accepts .avail files (the Avail library), parses them, and captures the method and class comments with the intent of auto-generating a web-based navigable documentation system for the Avail library (basically, taking .avail files and generating HTML from the comments in the files).  I'm on iteration four of this project and I'm fairly confident that this is the last restart I'll be doing.
</p><p>
As for today, I'm Todd's research assistant for the academic paper he is composing on semantic restrictions.  I'm combing through academic papers looking for information and ideas that relate to our topic.
</p><p>
So welcome to my blog!  Now it is high time I get back to combing through academic papers.
