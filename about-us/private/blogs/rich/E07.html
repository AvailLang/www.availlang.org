<h2 class="content-title">Tries and more trees</h2>

<div class="content-meta-info">November 15, 2012</div>
<p>
So it is that time of the year again.  I saw xmas trees for sale outside the grocery store last night.  I half considered picking one up...ok, maybe one one-hundredth considered it.  It may sound sad, but since I left home all those millennia ago to live under my own roof, I have not put up a xmas tree.  The closest I ever got to a tree was way back when I was 23 and living with my cousin.   We took a string of lights and wrapped it around a stand lamp.  As I considered said tree last night, I had no idea that tonight, I'd learn a "new" spelling for the word tree...
</p><p>
Or more precisely, <em>trie</em>.  On my quest to build Stacks I have learned many a new things.  I've improved the quality of my code writing as I've gotten better at compartmentalizing things and factoring code so that I only solve a problem once.  Recognizing the fact that I've been re-writing the same type of procedure over and over, I decided to generalize it.  The procedure of which I speak is the act of reading characters from an iterator over delimited regions.  A delimited region would be things like comments, text in blocks and in quotes (/*...*/, [...],"...").  I pretty much got tired of reconstructing this same algorithm over and over as it always takes a while to build each time I need to implement it.  So I wised up and decided to create the method <code>"read_'s⁇region delimited by_and_«with|without»!nesting"</code> in the module <em>Avail Scanner</em>.  It is a method that accepts a scanner and reads a delimited region indicated by the provided delimiters.  Here is the signature of the simple character delimited version of the method:
</p>
<div class="restricted-width-container">
<div class="good-code code-block">"read_'s⁇region delimited by_and_«with|without»!nesting" is
   [Avail scanner, character, character, [1..2]]→string</div></div>
<p>
The part of the signature corresponding to the integer range type, <code>[1..2]</code> is the optional words with in the guillemets, <code>«with|without»!</code>.  This method will be called using the word "with" or the word "without".  The method will apply the correct behavior given the request.  This allows me to write one method that handles similar functionalities.  (Note: in order to use the nesting feature, the start delimiter and the end delimiter must be different).  If <code>with</code> is used, the fourth input will correspond to the value "1".  If <code>without</code> is used, the fourth input will use the value "2".  You can put as many options delimited by pipes in the guillemets as long as you have the correct integer range to adequately represent all the options. Since comments are delimited by a series of strings ("/*" and "*/"), I also composed the string version of this method:
</p>
<div class="restricted-width-container">
<div class="good-code code-block">"read_'s⁇region delimited by_and_«with|without»!nesting" is
   [Avail scanner, string, string, [1..2]]→string</div></div>
<p>
This is where things got a wee bit tricky.  The case in which we are not allowing nested regions is fairly trivial.  The part that gets more difficult is when you wish to handle nesting.  After discussing this with Todd, it was determined that the best approach would be to implement a <em>Patricia Trie</em>.  The spelling "trie" threw me all night.  It is tricky to spell something different after spelling it one way all your life.  I tripped myself up by doing this: <code>tree : patricia trie</code>, but spelling the respective "trees" wrong.
</p><p>
My little detour resulted in the construction of the module <code>Patricia Trie</code>.  Not having heard of <a href"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radix_tree">patricia tries</a> before, it was sort of fun to build this concept in Avail.  In the case of the nested region read, I add the start and end delimiters to the patricia trie.  I then navigate the trie as I read elements from the scanner's source.  This permits me to handle both the start and end delimiter simultaneously in an efficient manner.  The part that I'm still working on is the case where the delimiters are extensions of each other.  For example, the words <em>slug</em> and <em>slugs</em> are related as they share the same base word, slug.  If these two words were the delimiters, I'd need to check if I will reach the word "slugs" once I've found the word "slug".   As a delimiter, "slugs" would take precedence over "slug".
</p><p>
Now that I've bored you and increased the weight of my eyelids 100-fold, I should definitely catch some z's.  I may come back later to update this post with more info on patricia tries and how I implemented them in Avail.  Otherwise, I should probably try and write these blogs just a tad earlier in the night.

Now it is off to dreamland to dream about all things trees and tries...
