<p>Happy new year and welcome to my first blog of 2013.  A new year often symbolizes a fresh start, something new.  My last post on the <a href="/content/substrings-historical-tidbit-and-few-shoutouts">KMP string searching algorithm</a> got me thinking about something I could try in my future blog posts.  Seeing as part of the purpose of this blog is to introduce people to actually programming in Avail,  I've decided that from time to time, I should take a break from what I'm doing to build common algorithms in Avail and talk about them here.  This will give me the opportunity to demonstrate Avail implementations of generally well understood programming algorithms (as well as learn a thing or two as I go).  Through this I hope to show off some functionality to be found in the standard Avail library.  This should be especially helpful seeing as a certain slacker hasn't quite finished his project on converting Avail files into a fully navigable library website...</p>

<p>Speaking of Stacks, a quick update on that before I get into my first post in my common algorithm series,  <em>Common Algorithm Series: An Avail Approach to Insertion Sort</em>.  I just made that name up; perhaps it will stick?  I'll go with that for now unless it meets staunch resistance...  So right, Stacks.  I'm actually done with the lexer aside from a bug that I found while adding exception handling (good job exception handling!).  It appears that my handling of bracketed regions that cross new line boundaries is causing the line count to be off which results in erroneous line numbers for tokens.  This is for things such as <code>{@type "natural number"}</code> that will ultimately be treated as a link in the navigable library.  But I'll likely get back to that this weekend.  So on to my little diversion.</p>

<p><b>Common Algorithm Series: An Avail Approach to Insertion Sort</b></p>

<p>The place to start in my inaugural post to the common algorithm series is to give a quick overview on Avail methods.  A good way to describe Avail is that it is an <em>operation-oriented language</em> (operations take precedence in Avail).  In my experience, a lot of programming in Avail is done through the creation of methods.  The parameters' types of any given method defines the behavior dispatched at runtime for any method call (Avail supports multiple dispatch).  Though Avail has objects, method definitions are independent of any object.  With respect to methods, objects are treated like any other parameter (like whole number or 5's type).  So overloading methods in Avail is simply taking a method and defining different functions based upon the provided parameters' types.</p>

<p>For example, take the method <code>"_fires the_"</code> in the two following calls:
<code>Grandma fires the plumber</code> and <code>The submarine fires the torpedos</code>. The meaning of the word <em>fires</em> implied in a statement is usually based upon the context within which it is used.  Grandma is not picking up the plumber and using him as a projectile weapon, nor is the submarine sending the torpedos to the unemployment line.  Though the functionality of <code>"_fires the_"</code> implied for each call here is very different, the implementations of these methods can exist side by side in Avail without ambiguity because of the context in which they are used.   That context in the case of Avail are the types of the method's input parameters.  In the two examples of our method, <code>"_fires the_"</code>, we have the input types <code>[employer, employee]</code> for grandma and the plumber and <code>[weaponized vehicle,projectile]</code> for the submarine and the torpedos(these different parameter types of the inputs determines the implementation of the method used at runtime).</p>

<p>Another use for overloading in Avail is defining how a method reaches the desired result based upon the parameter inputs.  For example, some sorting algorithms are more efficient at sorting smaller tuples and less efficient at sorting larger tuples.  A sorting method can have different implementations for different ranges of tuple sizes using the most efficient sorting algorithms for the given range (you can read more about Avail's <a href="/content/types-tuple">tuple types here</a>).  I have done this with my implementation of the <a class="offsite" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merge_sort">merge sort algorithm</a> that will be discussed in my next post (cross my heart).</p>

<p>At much smaller tuple sizes, it is more efficient to use <a class="offsite" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insertion_sort">insertion sort</a> than merge sort due to the overhead of merge sort (here is a nice <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-science/algorithms#insertion-sort">video on insertion sort</a> put together by the Khan Academy).  Because of this, I have created multiple implementations of merge sort as a public method in the Tuples module of the library (a public method is exported for use outside the module).  In the implementation of merge sort for tuples with 2 to 10 elements, I have made a call to the private implementation of insertion sort to do the sorting (a private method is not exported and can only be used inside the module it is defined in).  My implementation of insertion sort only operates on tuples ranging in size from 2 to 10 elements (the merge sort algorithm is implemented for merge sort calls on tuples of 11 elements or more).</p>

<p>In order to better understand the Avail implementations I display, I'll list some of the methods used in them.  The part in quotes is the method itself, with the signature that provides the input and return values:  <code>[paramType1,paramType2]→returnType</code>.  Each underscore represents an input. Here is a list of methods used in the creation of the sort methods.</p>
<a id="methodsUsed"></a>
<ul>
<li><code>"↑_"</code> :: <code>[any meta]→variable meta</code> - Construct and answer a variable type with the specified containment type.
<li><code>"_++"</code> / <code>"_--"</code> :: <code>[variable]→⊤</code> - increment/decrement the numeric variable</li>
<li><code>"|_|"</code> :: <code>[tuple]→whole number</code> - returns the size of a tuple</li>
<li><code>"_[_↔_]"</code> :: <code>[tuple, natural number,natural number]→tuple</code> - accepts a tuple and swaps the elements at the two indices provided.</li>
<li><code>"_[_]→_"</code> :: <code>[tuple, natural number,any]→tuple</code> - accepts a tuple and swaps the element at the index with the provided element</li>
<li><code>"From_to_do_"</code> :: <code>[integer,extended integer,[⊥]→boolean]→⊤</code> - a loop that counts from value1 to value2 in increments of 1 performing the action in the input funtion</li>
<li><code>"While_do_"</code> :: <code>[[]→boolean,[]→⊤]→⊤</code> - a loop that checks the predicate function then executes the given function if the predicate is true.  The loop terminates when the predicate returns false.</li>
<li><code>"_∧_"</code> / <code>"_∨_"</code> :: <code> [boolean,[]→boolean]→boolean</code> - logical and / logical or</li>
<li><code>"If|if_then_«else if_then_»«else_»"</code> :: <code>[boolean,[]→⊤,<<[]→boolean, []→⊤…|2>…|1..>,<[]→⊤…|0..1>]→⊤</code> - standard conditional <em>if true then do this else do this</em>.  Each subsequent condition checked after the first is a no argument function that returns a boolean.  You can have as many of these <em>else if</em> conditions as desired before the final <em>else</em>.  It is not necessary to have an <em>else</em>.  The method will return ⊤ unless the method is used as an expression, which will return the result of the block function.</li>
</ul>
<p>The following is the method definition of insertion sort.  As it is only used in cases of tuples of 2 to 10 elements when calls are made to the library's merge sort or <a class="offsite" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quicksort">quicksort</a> methods, I've only defined it for use of the tuple type of the size range [2..10].  The implementation is fairly simple, so I'll let the inline comments provide the necessary explanations.
<div class="restricted-width-container">
<div class="good-code code-block">Private method "insertion sort_with_" is
[
	aTuple : &lt;any…|2..10>,        <font color="green">/*a tuple type of size [2..10]*/</font>
	<font color="green">/* a function type that takes two inputs and returns a boolean.  This function serves as the comparison
	 * criteria to assert the sorting rules of the tuple*/</font>
	comparator : [⊥, ⊥]→boolean

	output : &lt;any…|2..> := aTuple;  <font color="green">/*The tuple to sort in place*/</font>
	From 2 to |aTuple| do
	[
		i : [2..10]  <font color="green">/*type of the numeric range from 2 to 10*/</font>
	 |

		j : [1..9] := i - 1; <font color="green">/*counter of element to the left of the primary element being compared*/</font>

		];
	   <font color="green">/* When the head of the tuple is reached, the final comparison has to be completed outside of the
		* loop.  If this final comparison were to be completed in the loop, it would execute the block which

		output := if j = 1 ∧ [comparator(output[k],output[j])] then
			[output[k↔j]] else [output];
	];
	output     <font color="green">/*The return value*/</font>
]:&lt;any…|2..>;  <font color="green">/*The return type of the method*/</font>
</div></div>
For maximal utility of the definition of insertion sort as well as for merge sort, I employed the <a class="offsite" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy_pattern">strategy pattern</a> in order to permit the user of the method call to define the criteria of the sorting order.  For example, if I wanted to sort the tuple, <code>&lt;8,7,4,6,3,5,1,2></code> so that the tuple is sorted first in ascending odd numbers followed by descending even numbers, <code>&lt;1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 6, 4, 2></code>, then print it to screen, I would use the following call to insertion sort:
<div class="restricted-width-container">
<div class="good-code code-block">
aTuple : &lt;natural number…|1..8> := &lt;8,7,4,6,3,5,1,2>;  <font color="green">/*the tuple to sort*/</font>
<font color="green">/*a function that accepts as its inputs two natural numbers and determines the order they come in*/</font>
comparator :  [natural number, natural number]→boolean :=
[
   n : natural number, m : natural number
 |
   n is odd ∧ [m is even] ∨               <font color="green">/*n comes before m if n is odd and m is even */</font>
      [n is odd ∧ [m is odd ∧ [n ≤ m]]] ∨ <font color="green">/*n comes before m if n and m are odd and n ≤ m*/</font>
      [n is even ∧ [m is even ∧ [n ≥ m]]] <font color="green">/*n comes before m if n and m are even and n ≥ m*/</font>
];
<font color="green">/* insertion sort takes the tuple as the first input and the comparison function as the second input and
 * returns the sorted tuple.  In this case, the size of the tuple is exactly 8 elements.*/</font>
sorted : &lt;[1..8]…|8> := insertion sort aTuple with comparator;
<font color="green">/* The result is the printing of the tuple result, &lt;1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 6, 4, 2>.  The smart quotes are used in
 * conjunction with the print statement when the input type is not a subtype of the type string*/</font>
Print: “sorted”; </div></div>

<p>I think that is enough ground covered for one night.  When I initially set out, I was also going to discuss merge sort in this post.  Part way through writing this post, I decided to push merge sort to my next blog in order to keep this post from running overly long.  So look for my conversation on merge sort in my next post, <b><em>A diversion of sorts...part deux</em></b></p>
