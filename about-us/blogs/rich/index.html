<h2 class="content-title">Blogging Avail by Rich</h2>
<p>Hello there and welcome to my blog!  Here, I am able to be a little less formal about my personal experience with Avail. I'll apologize up front for any grammatical mistakes and spelling errors I might make, but being a blog, I won't be too sorry about that.  Though, I will try my best to write the <em>most goodest, error-proneless of blogs on all the internets</em>! &nbsp; ... &nbsp;  Well, I'll at least try to maintain the appearance of an educated individual.</p>
<p>If this is your first time visiting my blog, I recommend you read my <a href="./BERA001.html">blog welcome</a>.  It should clue you in on what to expect from my blogs.  I'll endeavor to keep my newest blogs up top while keeping this page in an order that is easy to navigate.</p>

<div class="content-meta-info">October 5, 2013</div>

<h4><a href="./BERA003.html">So many types, so little CPU time</a></h4>
<div class="content-meta-info">October 5, 2013</div>
<p>A basic discussion on the Avail type system.  Everything you've ever wanted to know about Avail's type system hasn't yet been committed to any one webpage, but until said page comes into existence, give this a read.  &nbsp; <a href="./BERA003.html">[read more&hellip;]</a></p>

<h4><a href="./BERA002.html">Informally speaking, what is a type?</a></h4>
<div class="content-meta-info">October 5, 2013</div>
<p>A basic discussion on types.  This is independent of the Avail type system, though it sets up a conversation for Avail's type system.  &nbsp; <a href="./BERA002.html">[read more&hellip;]</a></p>

<h4><a href="./BERA001.html">Let there be blogs!</a></h4>
<div class="content-meta-info">October 5, 2013</div>
