<h2 class="content-title">Welcome</h2>
<p><a href="./about-avail/introduction/index.html">Avail</a> is a multi-paradigmatic general purpose programming language whose feature set emphasizes support for articulate programming. Avail is an <a class="offsite" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source">open-source</a> project that comprises a <a class="offsite" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_machine">language virtual machine</a> and a <a class="offsite" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_library">standard library</a>. Both are released under the <a class="offsite" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BSD_licenses#3-clause_license_.28.22Revised_BSD_License.22.2C_.22New_BSD_License.22.2C_or_.22Modified_BSD_License.22.29">3-clause BSD license</a>.</p>

<p>The current release version of Avail is <code style="text-decoration: underline">1.0.0 DEV 2014-04-28</code>. This is a development release, and while it is believed to be useful, it is not recommended for production use.</p>

<p>To whet your appetite for Avail, below is a snippet from our largest example, <code class="module">Wump the Wumpus</code>. This application is an homage to Gregory Yob's BASIC classic, <a class="offsite" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunt_the_Wumpus">Hunt the Wumpus</a>, and can be found in its entirety (16 <a href="/about-avail/documentation/modules/index.html">modules</a>) in the <code class="module">/examples</code> <a href="/about-avail/documentation/modules/module-discovery.html">module root</a>.</p>
