<p>
<a href="./about-avail/introduction/index.html">Avail</a> is a multiparadigmatic general purpose programming language whose feature set emphasizes support for articulate programming. Designs for Avail originated in the 1980s and its implementation began in Smalltalk in 1993. New blood and new enthusiasm joined the project in 2010, and Avail was ported to Java. The Avail team has been growing ever since, and we are ramping up towards official release in the very near future.
</p><p>
We will be updating this website with information on the Avail project in general and the programming language in specific in preparation for its upcoming public release. In doing so, we hope that you become as excited as we are about the enormous applications and implications of Avail and its impact on the future of computing!

We have just moved away from a clunky CMS, so we are manually adding back functionality, such as the ability to subscribe to our <a href="./about-avail/newsletters/index.html">Newsletter</a>.
