<h2 class="content-title">Welcome</h2>
<p><a href="./about-avail/introduction/index.html">Avail</a> is a multi-paradigmatic general purpose programming language whose feature set emphasizes support for articulate programming.</p>

<p>This site is under very active development, as we are ramping up towards a long-awaited alpha release in the very near future. An Avail distribution will include a packaged binary virtual machine and an open-source standard library (released under the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BSD_licenses">3-clause BSD license</a>). The complete Avail distribution will be free for all educational or noncommercial use and for commercial use below a particular threshold of scale.</p>

<p>Much of the site is unfinished, but some very good information is already available. We hope that you become as excited as we are about the enormous applications and implications of Avail and its impact on the future of computing!</p>

<p>If you are interested in Avail, please bookmark the main page and check back intermittently. We have just moved away from a clunky content management system, so we are manually adding back functionality, such as the ability to subscribe to our <a href="./about-avail/newsletters/index.html">Newsletter</a>. If you would like to speak to any of the Avail team members, visit the <a href="./about-us/team/index.html">Avail Team</a> page.</p>

<p>Thanks for stopping by!</p>
