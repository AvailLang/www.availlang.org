<h2 class="content-title">Welcome</h2>
<p><a href="./about-avail/introduction/index.html">Avail</a> is a multi-paradigmatic general purpose programming language whose feature set emphasizes support for articulate programming. Avail is an <a class="offsite" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source">open-source</a> project that comprises a <a class="offsite" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_machine">language virtual machine</a> and a <a class="offsite" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_library">standard library</a>. Both are released under the <a class="offsite" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BSD_licenses#3-clause_license_.28.22Revised_BSD_License.22.2C_.22New_BSD_License.22.2C_or_.22Modified_BSD_License.22.29">3-clause BSD license</a>.</p>

<p>The current release version of Avail is <code style="text-decoration: underline">1.4.1</code>. This is a stable release, and recommended for production use.</p>

<p>To whet your appetite for Avail, below is a snippet from our largest example, <code class="module">Wump the Wumpus</code>. This application is an homage to Gregory Yob's BASIC classic, <a class="offsite" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunt_the_Wumpus">Hunt the Wumpus</a>, and can be found in its entirety (16 <a href="/about-avail/documentation/modules/index.html">modules</a>) in the <code class="module">/examples</code> <a href="/about-avail/documentation/modules/module-discovery.html">module root</a>.</p>

<h2 class="content-title">Recent News</h2>

<p><strong>2019.09.27:</strong> Avail <code style="text-decoration: underline">1.4.1</code> is out and recommended for all production use. This release addresses many long-term stability issues, as well as fixes for the dynamic translator that improve both performance and reliability.</p>

<p><strong>2019.08.16:</strong> Avail <code style="text-decoration: underline">1.4.0</code> is out and recommended for all production use. Avail has been rebuilt to use Gradle instead of Apache Ant. Interoperation with Java has received significant attention, and foreign function interfaces now work much more reliably and elegantly. Avail has received multitudinous improvements to its virtual machine and standard library, for correctness, performance, and ease of use. Despite the staleness of the website, Avail is evolving constantly &mdash; you can see this on GitHub. We hope to rebuild the website and commit more effort to it, but the active Avail team has shrunk to two developers. If you need to get in touch with anyone on the Avail team, send an email to <code>team@availlang.org</code> and we will try to respond as quickly as possible. Thanks!</p>

<p><strong>2018.05.25:</strong> The Avail team would like to thank <a class="offsite" href="https://www.jetbrains.com/">JetBrains</a> for supporting Avail development through a grant of open source licenses for <strong>IntelliJ Ultimate</strong> and related products. We hope to get proper tribute up on our acknowledgments page in the next few days, but the Avail team is wildly overcommitted to other non-Avail-related projects at the moment. The Avail team would also like to thank Jane Elizabeth of <a class="offsite" href="http://www.jaxenter.com">JAXenter.com</a> for her positive article. We are aware of the discussion on <a class="offsite" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=17150346">Hacker News</a>, and will try to participate if time allows. We have a new website in the works (no ETA, sorry), which we hope will address the many deficiencies of our current website. Unfortunately, the biggest deficiency is the team's (in)ability to keep the website up-to-date with accurate content. Avail has seen numerous colossal changes in the past year — e.g., we introduced custom lexical rules to support arbitrary, modular, incremental, backtracking tokenization of source files, we replaced the L2 interpreter with an optimizing dynamic translator for improved performance, etc. — but the team is just a few people, non-Avail-related projects are many, and documentation always ends up being a low priority for us until we start thinking hard about releasing. I apologize for the inadequacies of the site and the documentation, but please do not be deterred! If you need to get in touch with anyone on the Avail team, send an email to <code>team@availlang.org</code> and we will try to respond as quickly as possible. Thanks!</p>

<p><strong>2017.08.08:</strong> Avail now has <a href="/about-avail/newsletters/E009.html">modular lexers</a>.</p>

We choose to take this as evidence that Avail's sphere of influence is expanding. :)</p>

<p><strong>2014.12.19:</strong> <a href="/about-us/blogs/mark/MvG001.html">File I/O is now stable</a>. This also marks the first entry in <a href="/about-us/team/index.html#Mark">Mark</a>'s <a href="/about-us/blogs/mark">blog</a>.</p>

<p><strong>2014.10.16:</strong> <a href="/about-avail/newsletters/E007.html">Avail Newsletters, Edition #7: File I/O. Mostly.</a> is now available.  The construction work on file I/O and iterators is still ongoing, but open again for read-bound traffic.</p>

To download the new installer, visit the <a href="/about-avail/download/index.html">download</a> page. To update your script, do a <code>git pull</code> (as described on the <a href="/about-avail/download/get-source.html">Unix install instructions</a> page).</p>
